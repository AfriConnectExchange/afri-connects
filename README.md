  ## Running the code

  Run `npm i` to install the dependencies.

  Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
 
  NOTE: The mobile (Expo) app previously in `src/mobile-app` has been moved out of this repository. To run the web app:

  1. Run `npm install` at the repository root.
  2. Run `npm run dev` to start the Vite development server.

  If you still have the mobile app locally, run `npm install` inside that project's folder (it has its own `package.json`) and use `expo start`.
